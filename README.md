# Alert-System-with-Face-Mask-Detection
#### Introduction: 
An automated face mask detection system tells whether a person is 
wearing a face mask or not. It is useful to avoid the spread of diseases which spreads 
through the air. It is useful in crowded places like hospitals, malls, schools, etc.


#### Features: 
Along with face mask detection, when a person violates the face mask rule, 
it notifies the danger message through mail to the system admin. That danger message 
includes information like camera id, no. of masked person, no. of non-masked person, 
and date and time. It divides the output into three classes mask, non_mask, and 
improper_mask.

#### Tech Stack Used:
1) YOLO Algorithm
2) SMTP 

#### Streamlit is an open source app framework in python language.
It helps us create beautiful web-apps for data science and machine learning in a little time. It is compatible with major python libraries such as scikit-learn, keras, pytorch, latex, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc..
